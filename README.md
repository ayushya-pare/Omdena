# Machine Learning Model Development for Crop Yield Prediction: Ridge Regression Analysis and Recommendations

In this project, we aimed to develop a machine-learning model capable of predicting crop yields using both climatic and agricultural data.  he primary goal was to predict the yield of crops in hectares, a critical task for ensuring sustainable agricultural practices and better planning for food production.

## Technologies used
1. Data extraction - BeautifulSoup
2. EDA - Pandas, numpy, Mann-Kendall Trend analysis, Collinearity
3. Visualization - Matplotlib, seaborn, Geopandas 
4. Clustering / Segmentation - K-means
5. Machine learning - Modelling (PyCaret), Hyperparameter Tuning, Evaluation, MLFlow
6. Deployment - Docker, Flask, Streamlit
