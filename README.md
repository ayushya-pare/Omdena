# Machine Learning Model Development for Crop Yield Prediction: Ridge Regression Analysis and Recommendations

In this project, we aimed to develop a machine-learning model capable of predicting crop yields using both climatic and agricultural data.  he primary goal was to predict the yield of crops in hectares, a critical task for ensuring sustainable agricultural practices and better planning for food production.
